# Infinite-Resort
Play an endless runner style game in the same vein as Subway Surfers or Temple Run. This game was created by Ibrahim Labib and it's the final submission for my Game Development course at ESLSCA University. A big part of the project learns from and expands on the Udemy course Complete C# Unity 3D Game Development in Unity 6.
